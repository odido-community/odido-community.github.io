It works by telling your router to redirect incoming traffic on a specific port (like port 8080) to a specific device and port inside your local network. This is commonly used for hosting web servers, remote desktop access, or game servers from behind a router or firewall.</p>"},{"location":"guides/portforwarding/#security","title":"Security","text":"<p>While port forwarding is super useful, it does come with some risks. When you open a port to the internet, you're basically exposing part of your home network to the outside world. If the device or service you're forwarding to isn't secure, it could be an easy target for hackers or bots scanning for open ports. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to only forward what you really need, use strong passwords, keep devices updated.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Instead of opening ports on your modem or router, there are more secure options for accessing resources at home. Services like Cloudflare Tunnel and Tailscale (a VPN) let you securely connect to your devices without the risks of exposing ports. These tools create a safe, encrypted connection, making it much harder for unwanted visitors to get in while still giving you remote access to everything you need.</p>"},{"location":"guides/portforwarding/#configure","title":"Configure","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>This guide applies to all Odido modems.</p> <p>Follow these steps to configure port forwarding on your Odido modem:</p> <ol> <li>Log in to the Web UI.</li> <li>In the top-right corner, click the \"hamburger\" menu (three horizontal lines).</li> <li>Navigate to Network Settings &gt; NAT.</li> <li>In the Port Forwarding tab, click Add New Rule.</li> <li>Fill in the required fields:<ul> <li>Toggle Active to enable the rule.</li> <li>Enter a Service name (this can be any name you choose).</li> <li>For WAN Interface, leave it set to Default.</li> <li>Start Port: Enter the first port number for the external connection.</li> <li>End Port: Enter the last port number for the external connection.</li> <li>Translation Start Port: Enter the first port number for the internal LAN connection.</li> <li>Translation End Port: Enter the last port number for the internal LAN connection.</li> <li>Server IP Address: Enter the IP address of the device to forward traffic to.</li> <li>Protocol: Select the protocol\u2014TCP, UDP, or both\u2014depending on the service you are forwarding.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"guides/portforwarding/#type-of-forwards","title":"Type of forwards","text":"<p>When setting up port forwarding, there are three common types of forwarding: Same Destination and Source Port, Different Destination and Source Port, and Same Destination and Source Port Range.
